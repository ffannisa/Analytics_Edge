# The Analytics Edge - Kaggle Data Competition
# Predicting Car Safety features Package

We have 4 files in our directory the prediction done in SVM (under svm.R), Neural Network (under neuralnetwork.R), XGBoost (under xgboost.R) and lastly the weighted average of all the mentioned predictions (under weighted average.R).

To run the probability prediction for submission:

*User should run svm.R, neuralnetwork.R and xgboost.R.

*Once all 3 files are runned, 3 csv files should be available under the user's directory.

*Now, user can run the file named weighted average.R, this file will result in the final csv for submission.

(under the name weighted_average_predictions.csv)
